# Hi, I'm Taylor

I am currently a steel worker aspiring for a career in software. 
If you are looking to take on a junior dev with a strong interest in learning, please feel free to reach out. I am currently located in Canada, but am very open to relocation for the right position!

### My skillsets

Admittedly my capabilities aren't super impressive. I have some exposure to dozens of languages, but have only really used/interacted extensively with;
 - Java
 - C
 - HTML/CSS
 - Javascript
and tend to use these choices primarily when building programs, though I am not afraid to try other options if they prove to be superior for the application.
